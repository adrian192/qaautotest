#summary Installing the test database

= Introduction =

This page describes how to install the test database on your machine.

== Requirements ==
  * Linux host (tested with Ubuntu 10.04)
  * Local installation of MySQL (tested with 5.1.41)
  * Python 2.6 (tested with 2.6.5)
  * PHP (tested with 5.3.2-1)
  * Web server running locally (tested with Apache/2.2.14)

== Installation ==
  * Check out the source code.
  * From the autotest directory, run install.py as root.
  * Default values are provided.  Type enter to accept the defaults or enter your own custom value.
{{{

Enter the root user name for the MySQL database [root]: 
Enter the corresponding password for the MySQL database: 
Enter the name of your web root [/var/www/html]: /var/www
Installation successful!
Connect to the GUI at http://localhost/autotest

== Troubleshooting ==
=== Page doesn't load ===
If, when you connect to `http://localhost/autotest`, you get an error indicating that the page cannot load, there are two likely explanations:
  * The web server isn't started.  Check the status of your web server with a command such as `service httpd status` or `/etc/init.d/apache2 status`.
  * The installation target directory wasn't the web root.  The default web root in the installation script is `/var/www/html`.  This is the default for CentOS.  Ubuntu uses `/var/www` as its default web root.  Make sure you have the correct web root configured.

=== Page gets downloaded, not displayed ===
If, when you connect to `http://localhost/autotest`, you get a request to download a file, this indicates that the index.php script isn't being correctly processed.  On Ubuntu, among other OSes, you may need to install the following packages:
libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-common php5-cgi

Also, verify that index.php is a valid index file in your apache configuration file.

== Uninstalling ==
  * Remove the installed files:
   # `rm -Rf <web_root>/autotest`
  * Remove the test case database:
   # `mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p`
   # `drop database autotest;`
