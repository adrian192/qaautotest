#summary Detailed solutions to overcome most problems.

This troubleshooting page should help resolve the most common initial installation and usage issues.  It will be updated as time goes by and as new issues are uncovered.


== Database ==

=== When connecting to the GUI for the first time, I am prompted to download a file or I see just a list of files ===
*Problem:* The index.php script isn't being correctly processed by your web server.

*Solution:*
  * Try installing the following packages: *Ubuntu:* `libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-common php5-cgi`.  *CentOS:* php.x86_64
  * Verify that index.php is identified as being a valid index file in your apache/httpd configuration file.
  * After making these changes, you must restart your web server, e.g. `service httpd restart` or `/etc/init.d/apache2 restart`
  * If you still get a download prompt after doing the above, and if you are usign Google's Chrome web browser, clear your browser's cache and reload the page.

=== Web page doesn't load ===
If, when you connect to `http://localhost/autotest`, you get an error indicating that the page cannot load, there are two likely explanations:
  * The web server isn't started.  Check the status of your web server with a command such as `service httpd status` or `/etc/init.d/apache2 status`.
  * The installation target directory wasn't the web root.  The default web root in the installation script is `/var/www/html`.  This is the default for CentOS.  Ubuntu uses `/var/www` as its default web root.  Make sure you have the correct web root configured.

=== ERROR 1045, Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES) ===
*Problem:* The password you have entered for administering the SQL server is wrong.

*Solution:*
  * When you install the Autotest database, a new user account is created just for this database.  The password may (should) be different than your root password.  Make sure you are using the correct password.
  * If you have forgotten your root password, the MySQL site has details on [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/resetting-permissions.html resetting your root password].
  * If you have forgotten the password used for administering your Autotest database, you can reset the password at the SQL server console by doing the following:
   # `mysql -u root`
   # `mysql> use mysql`
   # `mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new-password') WHERE user='<autotest_local_user>';`
   # `mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

=== ERROR 2002, Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket ===
*Problem:* The MySQL server is not installed or the service isn't running.

*Solution:*
  * Review the page on [http://code.google.com/p/qaautotest/wiki/MySQLSetup installing MySQL server] to make sure your SQL server is fully installed and the services are running properly.

=== ERROR 2003, Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' ===
*Problem:* Unable to connect to the database over the network.

*Solution:*
  * Make sure the firewall on the database server permits access to the SQL server.
  * Configure the MySQL server to allow external access to the database:
   # Open your `my.cnf` file (`/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or `/etc/my.cnf`).
   # If the line `skip-networking` is present, comment it out.
   # If the line `bind-address = 127.0.0.1` is present, change `127.0.0.1` to your machine's public IP address.
   # Restart the MySQL server: `service mysql restart` or `/etc/init.d/mysql restart`.
