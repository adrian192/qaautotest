#summary Detailed solutions to overcome most problems.

= Introduction =

This troubleshooting page should help resolve the most common initial installation and usage issues.  It will be updated as time goes by and as new issues are uncovered.


== Database ==

=== Unable to logon to the database ===
*Problem:* The database may not have been set up for use.

*Solution:*
  * Set up the database with a root password:
   # `mysql -u root`
   # `mysql> use mysql`
   # `mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new-password') WHERE user='root';`
   # `mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

=== When connecting to the GUI for the first time, I am prompted to download a file ===
*Problem:* The index.php script isn't being correctly processed by your web server.

*Solution:*
  * Try installing the following packages: `libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-common php5-cgi`
  * Verify that index.php is identified as being a valid index file in your apache/httpd configuration file.

=== Web page doesn't load ===
If, when you connect to `http://localhost/autotest`, you get an error indicating that the page cannot load, there are two likely explanations:
  * The web server isn't started.  Check the status of your web server with a command such as `service httpd status` or `/etc/init.d/apache2 status`.
  * The installation target directory wasn't the web root.  The default web root in the installation script is `/var/www/html`.  This is the default for CentOS.  Ubuntu uses `/var/www` as its default web root.  Make sure you have the correct web root configured.

=== ERROR 2003 connecting to the database ===
*Problem:* Unable to connect to the database over the network.

*Solution:*
  * Make sure the firewall on the database server permits access to the SQL server.
  * Configure the MySQL server to allow external access to the database:
   # Open your `my.cnf` file (`/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or `/etc/my.cnf`).
   # If the line `skip-networking` is present, comment it out.
   # If the line `bind-address = 127.0.0.1` is present, change `127.0.0.1` to your machine's public IP address.
   # Restart the MySQL server: `service mysql restart` or `/etc/init.d/mysql restart`.
